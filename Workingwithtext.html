        <h1>Introduction to Podcasting</h1>
        <p> A podcast is an episodic series of spoken-word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening. Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient and integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices. A podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to completely improvised.</p>

        <p>The cost to the consumer is low, with many podcasts free to download. Some are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale. Because podcast content is often free, podcasting is often classified as a disruptive medium, adverse to the maintenance of traditional revenue models.</p>

        <p>The name podcast comes from the iPodâ„¢ which was one of the most popular early portable MP3 players. Most podcasts still release their episodes as MP3 files to this day.</p>

        <h2>The Gear You Need</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, podcast doesn't have to be expensive. Starting your own podcast is less complicated or technically demanding than you may think. You only need a few things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A microphone</li>
            <li>Audio recording software such as Garage Band or Audacity</li>
            <li>Audio conferencing technology (Zoom, Skype, etc) if you wish to have a guest or co-host</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>Some computers have a built in microphone, but you may find the quality isn't as good as you'd like. You can purchase an affordable USB microphone at your local electronics store, or online for less than $40.</p>
